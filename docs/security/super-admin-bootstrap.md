# Super Admin Authentication Bootstrap

**Status:** ACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION BASELINE  
**Specifications:** AUTH-001, AUTH-010, SEC-001  
**Initial identifier:** `admin@hcis.sabilulquran.or.id`

This document defines the smallest real authentication boundary required before HCIS exposes employee import or other privileged administration surfaces.

## Scope

This phase creates one real `SUPER_ADMIN` account without implementing the full employee invitation, Google sign-in, role assignment, or permission-management UI.

The bootstrap account is an account principal, not an employee record. It must not be linked to a fake employee merely to obtain access.

## Invariants

- No public registration.
- No role selector on the login page.
- Passwords are hashed with scrypt and are never committed or logged.
- Super Admin MFA is mandatory from the first usable login.
- TOTP secrets are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM using `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` supplied by runtime configuration.
- Recovery codes are shown once and stored only as hashes.
- Browser sessions are opaque random tokens; only SHA-256 token hashes are stored in PostgreSQL.
- Production cookies use `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`, and `Path=/`.
- Account state must be `active` before a session can be created or reused.
- `/admin` is the Super Admin landing area. `/app` remains employee-only.
- Backend authorization remains authoritative; frontend route guards are usability boundaries, not the final authorization mechanism.
- Login success, login failure, MFA failure, recovery-code use, logout, and bootstrap are auditable events.

## Bootstrap safety

The bootstrap command:

1. requires `HCIS_ALLOW_SUPER_ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP=1` for that invocation;
2. receives the password through `HCIS_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD`, not a command-line argument;
3. takes the email from `--email`, defaulting to `admin@hcis.sabilulquran.or.id`;
4. acquires a PostgreSQL advisory transaction lock;
5. refuses to run when any `SUPER_ADMIN` already exists;
6. creates password + TOTP + recovery codes atomically;
7. never supports password rotation or a second privileged account through the bootstrap path.

Administrative account management after bootstrap must be implemented through the normal audited account-management domain, not by weakening this guard.

## Runtime secrets

Generate the MFA encryption key once per environment:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Store the resulting 64 hexadecimal characters only in the runtime environment as:

```text
AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<64 hex characters>
AUTH_SESSION_TTL_HOURS=8
```

Do not rotate `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` casually. Rotation makes existing encrypted TOTP secrets unreadable unless a controlled re-encryption migration exists.

## VPS bootstrap procedure

After the migration and API image containing this implementation are running:

```bash
cd /var/www/hcis
COMPOSE="docker compose --env-file infra/.env.vps -f infra/docker-compose.vps.yml"

read -s -p "Super Admin password: " HCIS_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD
echo
export HCIS_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD

$COMPOSE run --rm \
  -e HCIS_ALLOW_SUPER_ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP=1 \
  -e HCIS_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD \
  api \
  node apps/api/dist/modules/auth/cli/bootstrap-super-admin.js \
  --email admin@hcis.sabilulquran.or.id

unset HCIS_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD
```

The command prints a TOTP secret, an `otpauth://` URI, and recovery codes once. These values are sensitive and must not be pasted into chat, screenshots, issue trackers, or repository files.

## Login behavior

```text
POST /api/auth/login
  -> validate email + password
  -> if Super Admin MFA is configured and code is absent: MFA_REQUIRED
  -> validate TOTP or one unused recovery code
  -> create opaque server-side session
  -> set secure HttpOnly cookie
  -> frontend lands SUPER_ADMIN on /admin
```

Session lookup:

```text
GET /api/auth/me
```

Logout:

```text
POST /api/auth/logout
```

## Rate limit baseline

The first implementation limits failed login attempts per API process using an in-memory key composed from client IP + normalized email:

- maximum 5 failed attempts;
- 15-minute window.

This is acceptable for the current single API instance. Before horizontal API scaling, move this limiter to a shared adapter/store so the security boundary does not weaken across replicas.

## Acceptance criteria

- AUTH-001-A: entering `/app` without an authenticated employee session does not expose the employee workspace.
- AUTH-001-B: a bootstrapped Super Admin lands at `/admin`, not `/app`.
- AUTH-001-C: an invalid password does not create a session and produces an audit event.
- AUTH-001-D: Super Admin cannot create a session without valid MFA.
- AUTH-001-E: recovery codes are single-use and stored only as hashes.
- AUTH-001-F: session cookies are HttpOnly and Secure in production.
- AUTH-001-G: suspended/inactive accounts cannot reuse an otherwise valid session.
- AUTH-001-H: bootstrap refuses to create another Super Admin once one exists.
